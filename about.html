								<h3>Everything into Frozen<br>
									& Fresh!</h3>
								<br>
								<p>We at Papaji’s offer you the complete Frozen category alongwith Exotic fresh veg. </p>
								<p>Our journey into this started off from Raigad district in times
									wherein retail stores were not functional. This is when our customers understood the real benefits of frozen food.</p>
								<p>There are a lot of advantages to buying frozen foods or freezing
									your own related to quality, nutrition, cost and safety. Frozen
									produce is picked at its peak and flash frozen to maintain all the
									flavor and nutrients. The Frozen Food Foundation says that
									frozen fruits and vegetables are equally, and possibly more nutritious than fresh. Freezing suspends microbial and fungal activity in the food. </p>
								<p>As long as the food remains frozen, it is safe.</p>
								<p>Vegetables are usually frozen within hours of being harvested.
									This also means there is minimum attrition of vitamins and minerals so there is a definite nutritional benefit to frozen food.
									Frozen food does not require preservatives. It is a wholly natural process that simply takes a reduction in temperature and
									packaging. Frozen food also makes seasonal food more affordable throughout the year.</p>
								<p>Other advantages of buying Frozen food is that it helps in
									Carbon footprint reduction thereby supporting the environmental cause.</p>
								<p>All the brands on our platform use the best possible methods
									to maintain hygiene while packing the products. Quality and
									Freshness is guaranteed with each product. Brands working
									with Papaji’s maintain WHO standards of hygiene checked by
									the Quality Assurance Team.</p>
								<p>We at Papaji’s understand our customers’ needs and the current scenario. In tune to that we have built a robust online ordering and delivery platform to get you your desired product in
									the least possible time.</p>
								<p>Trust us to be your neighborhood online Frozen to Fresh preferred store….</p>
